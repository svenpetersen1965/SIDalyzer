# SIDalyzer
This is a software for analyzing the Commodore C64 SID sound chip/synthesizer. Every parameter for every voice can be set separately.

The purpose of this software is testing the register settings or the function of the SID (or a SID replacement/emulation).

The base address of the SID can be selected from a list or entered manually.

The operation page shows one voice and the other parameters, which can all be modified, either by keyboard 
or by joystick. The voice can be switched on or off by hitting the space bar. Navigation with the joystick 
is up/down/left/right. To modify a value, hold down the fire button and move the joystick up/down/left/right. 
Some parameters have a wide range of values. So modify the parameter by plenty steps, either hold down fire and 
move left or right or hold down SHIFT and press + or -.

The navigation with keys is described in the opening page of the software:

The settings can be printed out on a printer (e.g. MSP803) with a device address 4 (standard).
